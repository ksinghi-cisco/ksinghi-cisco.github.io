### About syntax highlighting

For syntax highlighting, use fenced code blocks optionally followed by the language syntax you want:
## Available lexers

The keywords you must add to specify the highlighting (in the previous example, `ruby`) are called "lexers." You can search for "lexers." Here are some common ones I use:

* js
* html
* yaml
* css
* json
* php
* java
* cpp
* dotnet
* xml
* http
